        <p class="text-black-50 mx-auto mt-2 mb-5">So, it’s been awhile since I have sat down to write a blog entry. I have had grand gestures to make this a journey of my learning experience with programming and cybersecurity. To catch everyone up on my journey, I am currently in my senior year at SNHU online in the BS of Computer Science. I do not have a concentration but have taken elective courses and participated in two seasons of National Cyber League CTF competition. I am leading my Computer Science degree into the cybersecurity direction. Additionally, if don’t already know, I am the found and co-host of Off The Rails Cybersecurity Podcast. I have made plans to continue my education onto my master’s degree in Cybersecurity, either at SNHU or moving over to Georgia Tech’s Master’s of Cybersecurity online. I haven’t completely decided, and I love SNHU since I started back in 2017.</p>
        <p>I am currently taking two courses that I have been waiting to take: Software Reverse Engineering and Network & Telecom Management (utilizing the TestOut Network Pro learning environment). The Network course is equivalent to the Comptia Network+ certification course. During the past two season of NCL I have learned a tremendous amount of information on networking and even disassembling other programs. During the network course I have clearified so much information that I only knew bits and pieces, such as the OSI Model, common protocols and their meaning, and IP addresses. The most exciting part is learning assembly code and disassembly binary files to determine how programs are compiled into machine language. This comes with learning different debuggers, but mainly GDB the GNU decompiler. I have fell in love with reverse engineering. I love the idea of taking someone else’s program and much like code reviews determining how the program works, what the methods are calling, but further into it determining how to either exploit the code to fix it or expose a possible exploit to a program’s organization. This would also lead to malware analysis and even possible penetration testing of organizations. I additionally I am leading a CompTia Sec+ study group and take my certification test in Jan or Feb of 2020. This will assure I have the knowledge to help in my new career field after graduation.</p>
        <p>Overall, I’m excited to within half a year away from graduating with my BS in Computer Science, TestOut Network Pro Certification, CompTIA Sec+ cert, and four seasons of NCL CTF ethical hacking competitions under my belt. All of this has opened my eyes to a new area (or unknown to my passion) of technology. It’s the perfect combination of my 10 years of law enforcement knowledge and my technology passion. Through my studies I have learned that I have a great passion for cryptology and encryption systems and have set a goal to create a new highly effective encryption system before I retire. I have been actively seeking new employment in the software development/cyber security development and analyst aspect and hope to be working in the industry before or as I graduate. I have many plans to continue my own education and eventually, after finishing my degree, help teach others in this new arena. I want to gain more certifications and attend or even speak at conferences.</p>
